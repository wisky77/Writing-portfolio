    <h1>The Weight of Waiting</h1>

    <p>It’s one in the morning. Sleep is an idea, not a reality.<br>
    Something lingers in the air.<br>
    Not smoke. Not sirens.<br>
    Something heavier — something that drifts through closed windows and settles deep in the bones.<br>
    It doesn’t shift with the wind. It doesn’t leave when the screens go dark.</p>

    <p>You scroll.<br>
    And the timeline bleeds:<br>
    Youth with dreams turned headlines,<br>
    Children caught in crossfire,<br>
    Mothers clutching grief that language cannot hold,<br>
    A nation pacing between protests and prayers.</p>

    <p>What is this thing that wakes us?<br>
    That hushes sleep and stirs silence into static?</p>

    <p>The country is ailing — and the pain isn’t whispered anymore.<br>
    It’s screamed in alleys, echoed in hashtags, folded into coffins.<br>
    I mourn the lives we lost before they ever lived.<br>
    The dreams aborted by bullets, the futures that never learned to spell hope.</p>

    <p>Mainstream media whispers about peace.<br>
    But behind closed doors, abduction is the dialect of power.<br>
    Bodies surface with wounds that speak louder than broadcasts.<br>
    And if you think that’s where the horror stops — brace yourself.</p>

    <p>The jaw-dropper?<br>
    A shoot-to-kill order.<br>
    Not barked by rogue officers.<br>
    But issued by the very leaders meant to shield us.<br>
    Elected voices now echo like threats.<br>
    And somehow, we’re told this is stability.</p>

    <p>So we wait.<br>
    Not because we trust the silence,<br>
    but because we’ve run out of ways to scream.</p>

    <p>How long does a nation hold its breath<br>
    before it forgets how to exhale?</p>

    <p>The streets are tired.<br>
    The names are many.<br>
    The questions echo louder than the answers.</p>

    <p>And still — something stirs.<br>
    A shift. A whisper. A pulse beneath the pavement.</p>

    <p>When will it end?<br>
    No one knows.<br>
    But if it does,<br>
    may it end with truth,<br>
    not just quiet.</p>
